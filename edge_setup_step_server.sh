"""set -e will cause the script to exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
sudo apt-get update updates the package lists for upgrades and new package installations.
sudo apt-get install -y git sshpass maven docker.io docker-compose installs necessary packages including Git, Maven, Docker, and Docker Compose.
The script checks if a directory exists where the edge code is supposed to be cloned; if not, it clones the repository.
It then navigates into the directory and runs a Maven build, skipping tests for speed in a deployment scenario.
Docker Compose is used to bring up the services defined in a docker-compose-edge.yml file, which you would need to define according to your application's architecture.
There's a placeholder for additional setup steps, like database configuration or copying configuration files.
It ends by checking the status of the Docker containers to ensure they are running."""
