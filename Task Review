Project Overview:
The project focuses on refactoring an extensive monolithic industrial IoT system for water treatment monitoring, which is deeply integrated with the Thingsboard IoT platform. It involves sensor data collection, actuator control, and data telemetry.

Current System Structure:

A single extensive script (h2o.py) acts as the core of the system.
Global variables are heavily utilized for configuration and state management.
Sensor and actuator integrations are hard-coded and inflexible.
Fixed intervals for data transmission to Thingsboard result in high network traffic.
A bespoke Modbus library manages RS485 sensor communications.
Refactoring Goals:

Modularization: Decompose the codebase into distinct modules for better manageability and scalability.
Optimization: Refine data transmission with adaptive scheduling and enhance timer logic for more efficient task management.
Architecture Enhancement: Develop a centralized configuration system and a plug-and-play framework for devices.
Responsibilities:

Thoroughly analyze the current codebase to pinpoint refactoring needs.
Craft a modular architecture that promotes separation of concerns.
Introduce a central configuration management system.
Construct an extensible framework for seamless sensor and actuator integration.
Modernize the Modbus library for consistent and reliable communication.
Generate extensive documentation to facilitate future development and maintenance.
Implementation Steps:

Code Modularization: Split the code into logical units, each with a clear purpose.
Error Handling Improvement: Strengthen exception handling across the system.
Configuration Management Enhancement: Replace global variables with a centralized configuration manager.
System Calls Optimization: Utilize Python libraries for more efficient system and sensor operations.
Thingsboard Synchronization: Integrate synchronization mechanisms directly within the configuration management system.
Code Review and Refactoring: Conduct a meticulous review and refinement of the codebase post-improvements.
Testing: Implement robust testing procedures to verify system integrity and functionality.
Additional Considerations:

Transition away from using State.json in favor of real-time Thingsboard synchronization.
Strategize sensor data collection and device integration to promote ease of adding new devices.
Leverage the existing PostgreSQL database for structured sensor data storage.
Introduce configurable timing mechanisms for variable sensor reading intervals, enhancing flexibility and efficiency.
Documentation:

Code Documentation: Annotate the code with comprehensive comments and explanations.
User Guide: Provide detailed instructions for system deployment and operation.
Developer Guide: Describe the system architecture and guidelines for extending the system with new functionalities.
